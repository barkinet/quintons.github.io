With each and every project, what I pride myself on is a finished well-polished maintainable and future scalable product that the client is pleased with.<p>I have played a key role in the development of front-end solutions and the sourcing of other front-end developers to build a team. My experience has pulled me in directions that cover both Mobile application developments using Titanium and front end website solutions.<ul class=content__page-nav-list><li><p class=page-nav-list__heading>Contents<li><a href=#passion>The passion of digital</a><li><a href=#overview>Overview of my career</a><li><a href=#education>Education</a><li><a href=#tools>Tools of choice</a></ul><hr><h2 class=content__subheading id=passion>The passion of digital</h2><p>Ever since I stumbled across the Internet in the mid 90’s I have been fascinated as to what is possible and how an idea can flourish into a solution. Interactive digital media and the ever-expanding usage no matter the device has come leaps and bounds.<p>From starting out in digital design and interactive media, to moving head long into development both on the backend and now within the front-end, I have placed myself in a position that is an advantage to any client. Front-end development is as much as UI design as it is programming, one without the other does not make the whole – you need an understanding of both to appreciate what can be possible.<h2 class=content__subheading id=overview>Overview of my career</h2><p class=content__detail--company><span>Ark Workplace risk, London</span> <span>Lead Mobile Applications Developer</span> My primary role was to lead a team to develop new functionality on their current Mobile risk and workplace compliance iOS application using Titanium as the core development environment. It was a mixture of both web development and JavaScript development using the Titanium API. One of the first things I did at Ark was to re-organise the processes and workflow to make the development faster and more efficient.<p><span>Salmon, Watford</span> <span>Front end UI web developer</span> When I joined Salmon I was placed right into the team developing the front end (mobile and desktop) of the Halfords.com ecommerce website, a 5 year long pre-existing solution that had a large amount of issues both within the JavaScript and CSS. Working with a team of Java developers and other front-end developers as well as the design team.<p class=content__detail--company><span>Tilney Bestinvest Ltd, London</span> <span>Front end UI/JavaScript Developer</span> I was the lead front end JavaScript UI developer for both the internal and external websites to Bestinvest. During a complete re-work of the front-end architecture I interviewed, chose and lead a team of developers. Over the course of the projects life cycle and beyond, and importantly with any project, I shared my knowledge through talks on different technical subjects that were beneficial to the front-end team. To a limited extent this knowledge was also transferable to the backend team who wished to know more about the architecture and developments.<p class=content__detail--company><span>Knowledge Solutions, Royston</span> <span>Web Applications Developer & Designer</span> I was a senior web application developer responsible for the full lifecycle. From design, development and implementation of business critical web applications and thin clients using Microsoft web technologies. During the course of my time with Knowledge solutions, I developed a student management system to track student’s progress through eLearning material and gather reports passed that were passed onto a manager. The application was sold onto large multi national companies, banks and governmental institutions. I was also instrumental in the development of a bug tracking system, which was used internally.<h2 class=content__subheading id=education>Education</h2><p><span>UWCN (University of Wales, College Newport)</span> <span>Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Audio Visual Design and Development</span> During my studies at the university I took on teaching classes to students on 3D design modelling, lead projects from its conception to the final presentation involving multiple people and at times teams - some projects involved the design and development of complete interactive 3D spaces with the aid of using a cyber globe to interact with the UI and its virtual environment. however, I turned myself to web development initially using Notepad as the tool of choice, became involved in developing an online business advertising companies in the south west, worked with the Alpine club to design and develop there website and from there on in became a web developer.<h2 class=content__subheading id=tools>Tools of choice</h2><p>I have come to use multiple tools over time but currently using a 2011 MacBook Pro with a 24" Dell UltraSharp display. for me the old fashioned method of pen and paper at the start of a project is the best way to flesh out ideas, then I will turn to <a href=https://www.sketchapp.com/ target=_blank>Sketch</a> to finalise the design, <a href=http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html target=_blank>Photoshop</a> for touching up photographic material, <a href=http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html target=_blank>illustrator</a> for more complex vector based designs and <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ target=_blank>Webstorm</a> during the developmental stages testing in chrome as the base browser. For the repository of code, <a href=https://github.com/ >Git</a> has become the tool of choice however, if I work within a company I have to keep to there chosen repro.</div></div></article><footer class=footer-wrapper><div class=footer-top><div class="[ row medium-10 large-8 small-10 ]"><section class="tweets [ columns medium-12 large-6 small-12 ]"><h3 class=tweets__heading>Latest tweets</h3><ul class="tweets__list js-tweets"><li class=tweets__item><p>Loading tweets...</ul></section><section class="posts [ columns medium-12 large-6 small-12 ]"><h3 class=posts__heading>Latest posts</h3><ul class=posts__list><li class=posts__item><p class=item__desc>Mauris lacinia porta faucibus<p class=item__cat>Category Name<li class=posts__item><p class=item__desc>Mauris lacinia porta faucibus<p class=item__cat>Category Name<li class=posts__item><p class=item__desc>Mauris lacinia porta faucibus<p class=item__cat>Category Name</ul></section></div></div><div class=footer-bottom><div class="[ row ]"><div class="[ columns ]"><p class=footer-bottom__copy-text>Copyright &copy; Quinton Sheppard - All code for the blog is available on <a href=https://github.com/quintons/ class=footer-bottom__git-link>GitHub</a></div></div></div></footer><div class="totop [ row columns ]"><a href=# class=totop__link>top</a></div></div><a class=twitter-timeline data-width=220 data-height=200 data-theme=dark data-link-color=#B8B8B8 data-tweet-limit=2 data-chrome="nofooter transparent noborders noscrollbar" href=https://twitter.com/quintons>Tweets by quintons</a><script async src=//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js charset=utf-8></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
